# SDS-M1-exam-datasets

This project is made by Sasha Junker and Malek Qasem as part of the exam in Social Data Science M1. The goal is to analyse a dataset of all 800 pokemon along with 41 features that describe each of them.

We delved into questions such as:
- Does pokemons with two types separate themselves from those who only have one?
- Do pokemon types relate differently to each other in the newer generations?
- Can we predict if a pokemon is legendary?
- Can we predict the type of a pokemon?
- Can we predict the outcome of a pokemon battle, based on the features of the pokemons that are fighting?

These questions, and more, is answered in the colab link along with the stakeholer report
